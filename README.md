# discordBotClient.js
My own discord client that I'm working on. Currently supports most raw stuff, with application commands as the main focus.

Before I add more general support and docs I highly recommend using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/), it got in general more support (and more people working on it), but if you're up for the challange I'd be happy to let you use this client!

More stuff coming when I've got the time to add them, and usually pretty random times for updates.

Latest update: [0.1.1](https://github.com/jamme05/discordBotClient.js/tree/main/Updates)
