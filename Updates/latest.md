## Version 0.1.1 codename: (idk first time)

### New:
- Reworked Client.js and made it (according to me) easier setting up listeners.

### In the works:
- Making the client more async.
- Making it easier to create, edit and load commands (Command.js and CommandsClient.js).
- Adding more handlers and classes for events.

More in depth updates coming in th future!
